# A review of optical flow for a final project in ECE 6560 at Georgia Tech.
A review of optical flow. project_main.py is the main program that implements the qualitative analysis on the fidelity term as well as plotting the images and calculating the RMSE value between the ground truth motion and the calculated motion from Horn-Schunck optical flow. alg.py is the Horn Schunck optical flow model. utils.py is code borrowed from D. Sun that was used to find the ground truth vectors for the chosen images.
